# Part-Time workers in the UK from 2018 to 2022

People in employment can work on a full-time or a part-time basis. A part-time worker is someone who works fewer hours than a full-time worker. There is no specific number of hours that makes someone full or part-time, but a full-time worker will usually work 35 hours or more a week. In the UK Labour Force Survey, the split between full-time and part-time employment is based on respondents’ self-classification. 

This report aims at mapping employment trends for part-time workers in the UK. We use the UK’s largest study on employment circumstances, the Labour Force Survey (LFS), drawing on analysis from the 2018 to 2022 releases (calendar quarters). Our analyses consider only those in employment (current jobs) between 18-64 years old.
